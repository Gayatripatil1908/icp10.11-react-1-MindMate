          <p>
            At MindMate, We believe that mental health is just as important as
            physical health. Our mission is to make mental wellness accessible,
            private, and easy for everyone. By combining mood tracking,
            journaling, and AI-powered conversations, we help you build a deeper
            connection with yourself â€” one day at a time.
